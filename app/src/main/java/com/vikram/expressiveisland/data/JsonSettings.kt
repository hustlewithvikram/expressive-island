 * [JsonSerializable.fromJson] — and this object owns everything above that: the document envelope
 * (a [FORMAT_KEY] marker plus a [VERSION_KEY]), assembling every store's section into one document
 * for export, checking that an incoming file is really one of ours, and routing each section back to
 * its store on import.
 *
 * The store instances live in `AppViewModel`; callers hand in an ordered label -> store map so the
 * set of sections is declared in exactly one place. The section labels below double as those map
 * keys, so the map and the validity check can't drift apart.
