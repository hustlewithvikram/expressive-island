 * does, which is what Shizuku lends us. Reflection rather than a stub AIDL for the same reason as
 * [StatusBarIconController]: transaction IDs are positional, so reflecting on the framework's own
 * class is what keeps this working across releases.
 *
 * There is no callback route to use instead. `startWatchingActive` reports other apps only to a
 * caller holding a signature permission no shell grant can supply, and the interface it calls back
 * on changed shape in Android 12. Polling is the version-stable option, and it only runs while the
