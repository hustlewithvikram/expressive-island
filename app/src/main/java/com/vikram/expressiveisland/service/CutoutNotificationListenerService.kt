 * progress bar, which the progress tile is there to show).
 *
 * It also lets the overlay dismiss the real notification (not just the pill): the connected
 * instance is published statically so [dismiss] can cancel a notification by key on the user's
 * swipe, mirroring a swipe-away in the shade.
 *
 * When the user asked for the shade to be cleared automatically, a mirrored notification is *held*
 * out of the shade (snoozed) rather than cancelled — see [hold]. Cancelling outright loses the
 * notification for good if nobody happened to be looking at the island while the pill was up, so the
 * island decides its fate instead: [releaseHeld] hands it back the moment the pill fades, while
 * [discard] destroys it because the user acted on the pill. With the setting off, nothing here ever
 * touches the real notification.
 *
 * A held notification is out of the framework's active list, so it cannot be cancelled by key while
 * the hold lasts. Both endings therefore re-snooze it for [RETURN_DELAY_MS] to fetch it back, and act
 * on the re-post: letting it settle into the shade silently, or cancelling it then.
