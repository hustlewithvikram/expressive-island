/**
 * Builds the animation specs for the island's primary motion — the appear/disappear reveal, the
 * size / position / corner transition and the background fade — from the user's animation settings.
 * Shared by the overlay island and the Animations screen's example pills, so the example previews
 * exactly the motion the real cutout uses.
 *
 * [AnimationStyle.EXPRESSIVE] uses spatial springs based on the Material 3 expressive
 * `MotionScheme` tokens (the `MotionScheme` API itself needs material3 1.4+; see [spatialSpec] for
 * how the values here deviate). [AnimationStyle.EASE_IN_OUT] uses a standard ease-in-out tween
 * scaled by the duration slider.
